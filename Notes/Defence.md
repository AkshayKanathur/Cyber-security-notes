# Security Operations Center (SOC)
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team that watches over a company’s network and systems to find and stop cyber threats. They focus on:

- Vulnerabilities: These are weak points in systems. If a fix (like a patch) is available, it should be applied. If not, extra steps must be taken to protect the system. SOCs may not always fix the issue, but they help spot it.

- Policy Violations: Companies have rules to keep their data safe. For example, uploading private company files to a public site breaks those rules. The SOC watches for these kinds of actions.

- Unauthorized Activity: If someone steals a user’s login and uses it to get into the system, the SOC works to catch and stop them quickly.

- Network Intrusions: Hackers can get into the network through fake links or by attacking servers. The SOC’s job is to detect intrusions early to reduce damage.

SOCs also work on threat intelligence, which means staying informed about new and possible threats.

### **Threat Intelligence**

Threat Intelligence is the process of gathering information about possible attackers and threats to help the company defend itself better. The goal is to build a **threat-informed defense**.

* **Threats**: Any action that can harm or disrupt a system.
* **Adversaries**: Different companies face different types of attackers.

  * A mobile company might be targeted for customer data.
  * A refinery might be targeted to stop production.
* **Examples of adversaries**:

  * Nation-state hackers (political reasons)
  * Ransomware groups (financial gain)

By understanding the likely threats, a company can prepare better security strategies.
