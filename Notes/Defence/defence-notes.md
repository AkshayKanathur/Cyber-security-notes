# Security Operations Center (SOC)
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team that watches over a company’s network and systems to find and stop cyber threats. They focus on:

- Vulnerabilities: These are weak points in systems. If a fix (like a patch) is available, it should be applied. If not, extra steps must be taken to protect the system. SOCs may not always fix the issue, but they help spot it.

- Policy Violations: Companies have rules to keep their data safe. For example, uploading private company files to a public site breaks those rules. The SOC watches for these kinds of actions.

- Unauthorized Activity: If someone steals a user’s login and uses it to get into the system, the SOC works to catch and stop them quickly.

- Network Intrusions: Hackers can get into the network through fake links or by attacking servers. The SOC’s job is to detect intrusions early to reduce damage.

SOCs also work on threat intelligence, which means staying informed about new and possible threats.

### **Threat Intelligence**

Threat Intelligence is the process of gathering information about possible attackers and threats to help the company defend itself better. The goal is to build a **threat-informed defense**.

* **Threats**: Any action that can harm or disrupt a system.
* **Adversaries**: Different companies face different types of attackers.

  * A mobile company might be targeted for customer data.
  * A refinery might be targeted to stop production.
* **Examples of adversaries**:

  * Nation-state hackers (political reasons)
  * Ransomware groups (financial gain)

By understanding the likely threats, a company can prepare better security strategies.

### **Adversary (Cybersecurity)**

An **adversary** is anyone who tries to attack or harm a system, network, or data. This can include hackers, ransomware groups, insider threats, or even government-backed attackers. They are the main threat that cybersecurity teams work to defend against.

### **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**

This includes three key areas:

* **Digital Forensics**
* **Incident Response**
* **Malware Analysis**

### **Digital Forensics**

Digital forensics is about investigating digital crimes using science and technology. It helps analyze attacks and gather evidence.

Key focus areas:

* **File System**: Looks into files on a device (including deleted ones) by examining a full system copy.
* **System Memory**: Captures what's running in memory, especially helpful if malware never touches the disk.
* **System Logs**: Tracks system activity. Even if hackers delete logs, traces may remain.
* **Network Logs**: Monitors data flowing in and out of the network to understand the attack.

### **Incident Response**

Incident response is how an organization deals with cyber attacks or breaches. The goal is to **reduce damage** and **recover quickly**.

#### Common incidents:

* Data breaches
* Website defacement
* Denial of service attacks
* Intrusion attempts
* Policy violations

#### Four Phases of Incident Response:

1. **Preparation**: Have a trained team and preventive measures in place.
2. **Detection and Analysis**: Spot incidents and understand how serious they are.
3. **Containment, Eradication, Recovery**: Stop the spread, remove the threat, and fix the systems.
4. **Post-Incident Activity**: Make a report and learn from the event to improve in the future.
