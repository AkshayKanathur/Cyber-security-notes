# Security Operations Center (SOC)
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team that watches over a company’s network and systems to find and stop cyber threats. They focus on:

- Vulnerabilities: These are weak points in systems. If a fix (like a patch) is available, it should be applied. If not, extra steps must be taken to protect the system. SOCs may not always fix the issue, but they help spot it.

- Policy Violations: Companies have rules to keep their data safe. For example, uploading private company files to a public site breaks those rules. The SOC watches for these kinds of actions.

- Unauthorized Activity: If someone steals a user’s login and uses it to get into the system, the SOC works to catch and stop them quickly.

- Network Intrusions: Hackers can get into the network through fake links or by attacking servers. The SOC’s job is to detect intrusions early to reduce damage.

SOCs also work on threat intelligence, which means staying informed about new and possible threats.

### **Threat Intelligence**

Threat Intelligence is the process of gathering information about possible attackers and threats to help the company defend itself better. The goal is to build a **threat-informed defense**.

* **Threats**: Any action that can harm or disrupt a system.
* **Adversaries**: Different companies face different types of attackers.

  * A mobile company might be targeted for customer data.
  * A refinery might be targeted to stop production.
* **Examples of adversaries**:

  * Nation-state hackers (political reasons)
  * Ransomware groups (financial gain)

By understanding the likely threats, a company can prepare better security strategies.

### **Adversary (Cybersecurity)**

An **adversary** is anyone who tries to attack or harm a system, network, or data. This can include hackers, ransomware groups, insider threats, or even government-backed attackers. They are the main threat that cybersecurity teams work to defend against.

### **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**

This includes three key areas:

* **Digital Forensics**
* **Incident Response**
* **Malware Analysis**

### **Digital Forensics**

Digital forensics is about investigating digital crimes using science and technology. It helps analyze attacks and gather evidence.

Key focus areas:

* **File System**: Looks into files on a device (including deleted ones) by examining a full system copy.
* **System Memory**: Captures what's running in memory, especially helpful if malware never touches the disk.
* **System Logs**: Tracks system activity. Even if hackers delete logs, traces may remain.
* **Network Logs**: Monitors data flowing in and out of the network to understand the attack.

### **Incident Response**

Incident response is how an organization deals with cyber attacks or breaches. The goal is to **reduce damage** and **recover quickly**.

#### Common incidents:

* Data breaches
* Website defacement
* Denial of service attacks
* Intrusion attempts
* Policy violations

#### Four Phases of Incident Response:

1. **Preparation**: Have a trained team and preventive measures in place.
2. **Detection and Analysis**: Spot incidents and understand how serious they are.
3. **Containment, Eradication, Recovery**: Stop the spread, remove the threat, and fix the systems.
4. **Post-Incident Activity**: Make a report and learn from the event to improve in the future.

#### Frameworks and controls

Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. Frameworks support organizations’ ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations. For example, the healthcare industry uses frameworks to comply with the United States’ Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires that medical professionals keep patient information safe. 

Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. Security controls are the measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy. For example, a control that can be used alongside frameworks to ensure a hospital remains compliant with HIPAA is requiring that patients use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access their medical records. Using a measure like MFA to validate someone’s identity is one way to help mitigate potential risks and threats to private data.
#### Specific frameworks and controls

There are many different frameworks and controls that organizations can use to remain compliant with regulations and achieve their security goals. Frameworks covered in this reading are the Cyber Threat Framework (CTF) and the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001. Several common security controls, used alongside these types of frameworks, are also explained. 
##### Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)

According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CTF was developed by the U.S. government to provide “a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.” By providing a common language to communicate information about threat activity, the CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently. This allows organizations to improve their response to the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape and threat actors' many tactics and techniques.
International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001

An internationally recognized and used framework is ISO/IEC 27001. The ISO 27000 family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties. This framework outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organization’s ability to manage risks. Although the ISO/IEC 27001 framework does not require the use of specific controls, it does provide a collection of controls that organizations can use to improve their security posture. 
##### Controls

Controls are used alongside frameworks to reduce the possibility and impact of a security threat, risk, or vulnerability. Controls can be physical, technical, and administrative and are typically used to prevent, detect, or correct security issues.

##### Examples of physical controls:

    Gates, fences, and locks

    Security guards

    Closed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance cameras, and motion detectors

    Access cards or badges to enter office spaces

##### Examples of technical controls:

    Firewalls

    MFA

    Antivirus software

##### Examples of administrative controls:

    Separation of duties

    Authorization

    Asset classification
